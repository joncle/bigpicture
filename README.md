BigPicture - Can you see the BigPicture?
=========================================

The goal of this project is to build an infinite blackboard with text editing,
and infinite zooming, with a GoogleMaps-like zooming feature.

Introducing a third dimension (zooming in and out) in text editing can help 
in various situations in order to have a wider view first, and look at 
details in a second time.

 USAGE :
 * CLICK on background : create a new textbox
 * CTRL + click down and motion : easy move (like in Google Maps)
 * CTRL + = : ZOOM + / CTRL + - : ZOOM -
