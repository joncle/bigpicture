BigPicture - Can you see the BigPicture?
=========================================

The goal of this project is to build an infinite blackboard with text editing,
and infinite zooming, with a GoogleMaps-like zooming feature.

Introducing a third dimension (zooming in and out) in text editing can help 
in various situations in order to have a wider view first, and look at 
details in a second time.
